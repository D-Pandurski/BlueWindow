# Questionnaire Answers:
    1. In the scenario of a tight release schedule, I would first focus on thorougly reviewing and understanding the specifications and business logic of the object in testing. I would create as few as possible test cases and tests, which achieve the highest percentage coverage of the component/system. 

    2. For multi-application support I would rely on creating Playwright custom fixtures and use them in parameterized tests, which would make maintenance easier in the long run. In this case introducing a new application into a set of tests I would only have to create additional fixtures (if necessary) and add new parameters to the tests.

    3. I think documentation is important, so I would start by re-reviewing the spec, in order to verify whether a feature was misunderstood or missed entirely. If this is the case, I would implement an even more thorough review of the documentation or a re-review once the test cases are complete, in order to validate if anything was missed.
    
    It is also possible that decisions were made in private conversations or in work item comments, so I would look at all related tasks (if viable) to confirm if this is the case and the QA team was not made aware. If a decision was made, I would suggest the documentation be updated ASAP or at the very least, the QA team be made fully aware of the decision.   

    I would contact the developer/development team that worked on the feature in order to understand the cause of the failure. 

    4. I would ensure that all information regarding the product is communicated in an understandable way and that it reaches all affected members of the project. If an issue is detected with a component, I would encourage the tester and developer to discuss the cause of the defect, how and why the actual outcome differs from the expected outcome. I would encourage frequent discussions among the QA team/s, as exchanging experience and discussing best programming and QA practices is crucial for the development of personal skills.
